# Intro
Solve puzzles and hacking challenges to find the keys and escape the simulated
universe and listen to some cool music at the same time!

# Contest
The Mammoth mini-CTF is a music themed mini-[CTF](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/)
that is mostly self-contained in an .mp3 file which will be posted in the github
repository when the contest starts. To listen to the song check it out on
[soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectmammoth/debugged-the-sound-of-an).

This mini-CTF is jeopardy style with 10 challenges.  The challenges are puzzle
based and generally involve music related themes.  They involve a wide variety
of things like steganography and hiding/encoding data in various music/audio
formats, a basic encryption challenge, a couple networking related challenges
and even a challenge involving chatting with an AI over the phone to convince
it to give you the key! No software or binary exploitation skills are required,
but some challenges are significantly easier to solve with coding/scripting.

The contest will start at 2023-08-05 00:00 UTC (2023-08-04 17:00 PT) run for just
over a week until 2023-08-14 00:00 UTC (2023-08-13 17:00 PT).

Registration for the contest will open a couple days before the event and
information will be posted here.

# Background
Help us escape this simulated universe!! We’ve just discovered that our Project
Mammoth counterparts from an adjacent universe have found a way to break out
of their universe and they’ve provided us with some clues to help us escape
ours as well!  You can help by solving these challenges to find the keys to
escape.

# Key Formats and submitting results
* Keys are in the format of `{MammothCTF}<16 hex nibbles>` (e.g.
  `{MammothCTF}ab12cd34ef56gh78`) and are case insensitive.
* Almost all keys will have the `{MammothCTF}` prefix when found in
  game, but any that do not will be clearly marked in the challenge description.
* Key submission will be done via the CTF contest page and requires creating an
  account for the site (details to follow shortly).
* Teams can share an account if desired.
* Winners with correct answers will be chosen with the earliest submission time
  (although the scoreboard only be tracking the highest scores).

# Prizes and Such
* The first 5 winners of the competition version will be announced on twitter.
* A live scoreboard will be posted when the contest starts.
* Prizes include a Mammoth CTF T-shirt and bragging rights! :)
* Please don’t release keys publically, at least until the
  contest is over.
* After the CTF is over, write-ups are very welcome!

# Help
If you’re stuck on a challenge and would like a hint, there are hints
listed with each challenge on the scoreboard site.  If you're still really
stuck, tag us or DM @prjctmammoth on Twitter, or alternatively email us at
prjctmammoth [at] gmail.com -- We want everyone with an interest at all
skill levels to have fun, so we're happy to help!  Responses are best
effort since we’ll also be attending Defcon :).

# About the song
This year's theme for the song is "The sound of an exploit".  It is our take
on the sound of a software exploit with sounds generated by tracing vulnerable
software as it is exploited by a buffer overflow.

The official contest version of the song file can be found in the github
repository after the contest starts.  You can also listen to the song
[on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectmammoth/debugged-the-sound-of-an),
but note that only the official .mp3 has the CTF contest data encoded in it.

Note: The contest mp3 file is benign and does not contain any exploits or
malicious payloads.  Other than having some extra metadata embedded in it,
it's a normal mp3 file and safe to open.  We'll update here with a VirusTotal
Scan link for reference when the contest starts.

# Notes
* The hints are not in the .mp3 file and are only available on contest page with
  a registered user.
* The video links in the notes sections of the challenges are sometimes hints,
  but sometimes just for fun :).
* Keep an eye on the notifications on https://ctf.projectmammoth.com/ and our
  twitter https://twitter.com/prjctmammoth for updates.

# Requirements
* Two of the challenges are played over a phone line and currently require
  the player to be able to call a US telephone number.  We are working on
  getting some kind of SIP connection or other free access to it but
  unfortunately may not have that ready by game time (sorry about that!).
* One challenge requires a NES emulator with "mapper 30" support and there
  are some open source and/or free options that will be posted in the notes
  for the challenge.
