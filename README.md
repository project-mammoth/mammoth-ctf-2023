# Summary
The Mammoth mini-CTF is a music themed mini-[CTF](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/)
that is completely self-contained in [an .mp3 file](https://github.com/project-mammoth/mammoth-ctf-2023/raw/main/TODO.mp3).
To just listen to the song check it out on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectmammoth/debugged-the-sound-of-an),
or for the full video [check here](TODO).
The official [CTF contest page is here](https://ctf.projectmammoth.com).

This mini-CTF is jeopardy style with 10 challenges.  The challenges are puzzle
based and generally involve music related themes.  No software or binary
exploitation skills are required, but some challenges are significantly easier
to solve with coding/scripting.

The contest will run for just over a week until 2023-08-14 00:00 UTC.

# About the song
This year's theme for the song is "The sound of an exploit".  It is our take
on the sound of a software exploit with sounds generated by tracing vulnerable
software as it is exploited by a buffer overflow.


The official contest version of the song file can be found
[here](https://github.com/project-mammoth/mammoth-ctf-2023/raw/main/TODO.mp3).
You can also listen to the song [on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectmammoth/debugged-the-sound-of-an),
but note that only the [official .mp3](https://github.com/project-mammoth/mammoth-ctf-2023/raw/main/TODO.mp3)
has the CTF contest data encoded in it.

Note: The [contest mp3 file](https://github.com/project-mammoth/mammoth-ctf-2023/raw/main/TODO.mp3)
is benign and does not contain any exploits or malicious payloads.  Other
than having some extra metadata embedded in it, it's a normal mp3 file
and safe to open.  Here's the
[Virus Total scan link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/TODO)
for reference.

# Notes
* The hints are not in the .mp3 file and are only available on ctf.projectmammoth.com with a registered user.
* The video links in the notes sections of the challenges are sometimes hints, but sometimes just for fun :).
* Keep an eye on the notifications on https://ctf.projectmammoth.com/ and our
  twitter https://twitter.com/prjctmammoth for updates.
