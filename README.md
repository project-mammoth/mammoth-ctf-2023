# Intro
Solve puzzles and hacking challenges to escape the simulated universe that we
all live in and listen to some cool music at the same time!

# Contest
The Mammoth mini-CTF is a music themed mini-[CTF](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/)
that is completely self-contained in [an .mp3 file](https://github.com/project-mammoth/mammoth-ctf-2023/raw/main/TODO.mp3).
To listen to the song check it out on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectmammoth/debugged-the-sound-of-an).
The official [CTF contest page is here](https://ctf.projectmammoth.com).

This mini-CTF is jeopardy style with 10 challenges.  The challenges are puzzle
based and generally involve music related themes.  No software or binary
exploitation skills are required, but some challenges are significantly easier
to solve with coding/scripting.

The contest will start at 2023-08-05 00:00 UTC (2023-08-04 17:00 PT) run for just over
a week until 2023-08-14 00:00 UTC (2023-08-13 17:00 PT).

To [register for the contest, please create an account here](https://mammoth.ctfd.io/register).

# Background
Help us escape this simulated universe!! We’ve just discovered that our Project
Mammoth counterparts from an adjacent universe have found a way to break out
of their universe and they’ve provided us with some clues to help us escape
ours as well!  You can help by solving these challenges to find the keys to escape.

# Key Formats and submitting results
* Keys are in the format of `{MammothCTF}<16 hex nibbles>` (e.g.
  `{MammothCTF}ab12cd34ef56gh78`) and are case insensitive.
* Almost all keys will have the `{MammothCTF}` prefix when found in
  game, but any that do not will be clearly marked in the challenge description.
* Key submission will be done via the [CTF contest page](https://mammoth.ctfd.io)
  and requires [creating an account](https://mammoth.ctfd.io/register) for the site.
* Teams can share an account if desired.
* Winners with correct answers will be chosen with the earliest submission time
  (although the scoreboard only be tracking the highest scores).

# Prizes and Such
* The first 5 winners of the competition version will be announced on twitter.
* A live [scoreboard can be found here](https://mammoth.ctfd.io/scoreboard)
  after the contest starts.
* Prizes include a Mammoth CTF T-shirt and bragging rights! :)
* Please don’t release keys publically, at least until the
  contest is over.
* After the CTF is over, write-ups are very welcome!

# Help
If you’re stuck on a challenge and would like a hint, there are hints
listed with each challenge on the scoreboard site.  If you're still really
stuck, tag us or DM @prjctmammoth on Twitter, or alternatively email us at
prjctmammoth [at] gmail.com -- We want everyone with an interest at all
skill levels to have fun, so we're happy to help!  Responses are best
effort since we’ll also be attending Defcon :).

# About the song
This year's theme for the song is "The sound of an exploit".  It is our take
on the sound of a software exploit with sounds generated by tracing vulnerable
software as it is exploited by a buffer overflow.

The official contest version of the song file can be found
[here](https://github.com/project-mammoth/mammoth-ctf-2023/raw/main/TODO.mp3).
You can also listen to the song [on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectmammoth/debugged-the-sound-of-an),
but note that only the [official .mp3](https://github.com/project-mammoth/mammoth-ctf-2023/raw/main/TODO.mp3)
has the CTF contest data encoded in it.

Note: The [contest mp3 file](https://github.com/project-mammoth/mammoth-ctf-2023/raw/main/TODO.mp3)
is benign and does not contain any exploits or malicious payloads.  Other
than having some extra metadata embedded in it, it's a normal mp3 file
and safe to open.  Here's the
[Virus Total scan link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/TODO)
for reference.

# Notes
* The hints are not in the .mp3 file and are only available on ctf.projectmammoth.com with a registered user.
* The video links in the notes sections of the challenges are sometimes hints, but sometimes just for fun :).
* Keep an eye on the notifications on https://ctf.projectmammoth.com/ and our
  twitter https://twitter.com/prjctmammoth for updates.
